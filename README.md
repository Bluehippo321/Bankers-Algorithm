# Bankers-Algorithm

The program takes a given amount of processes with given resource types, allocations, max, and avaiablity of said resources
Then it allows process to execute according to avaiable resources
It will not allow a process to overdraw, as it has no resources to give
It then stores the order that the processes execute, and then returns the status of the algorithm and states the order of completion

The program wasn't difficult to implement, fairly straightforward as no abstract objects were needed
Resources were also plentiful on the topic, so fixing issues was not a problem

Can be compiled with g++ bankers.cpp -o bankers

Then exectued with ./bankers\
